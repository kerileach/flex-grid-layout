                After promoting pharmaceuticals for 20 years, I decided I needed a change.
                    I discovered SkillCrush online and started taking classes. I found that I love writing clean, elegant code and creating beautiful and functional websites.

                I discovered SkillCrush online and started taking classes. I found that I love writing clean, elegant code and creating beautiful and functional websites.
                       I did some research and found the biggest complaints about web developers
                       are lack of communication and sub-par service. That is why I have built
                       my business with that research in mind.

                See, I think your business is a big deal.  That's why I provide excellent communication
                throughout the project and my goal is to deliver top notch service every time to every client
                regardless of the size of the business. I ask lots of questions and have a needs-based approach to your web design.
